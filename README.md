(Great) Course "Apprenez lâ€™objet avec Java (https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4989236-apprenez-l-objet-avec-java)" activity

## N.B :
  - some tests of FightTest are not functional, I couldn't grab the use of System.setIn() to set inputs for methods normally using a scanner. Any advise/correction on this is welcome !
  - some methods may be displayed as longer than 20 lines for code readability. I used the "Overly long method inspector" with the "Non-comment source statement limit" at 20 as criteria to check the length.
